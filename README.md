# Simple-Java-Game
Hi everyone
This project is a simple java game which I learn from the Channel TheChernoProject. Every source code here is the same at source code from
tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8q55FGysz4&list=UUQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw. I'm still working on it so if you want to understand the
source code please watch the tutorial on Youtube. 
Thank you
